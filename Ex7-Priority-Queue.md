# Ex7 Priority Queue
## DATE:
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters.
3. Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1.
4. Print each element of the array during the loop.
5. After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting.

## Program:
```
/*

*/
#include<stdio.h> int size = 0;
voidprintArray(int array[], int size)
{
int i; for(i=0;i<size;i++)
{
printf("%d ",array[i]);
}
printf("\n");
}
```

## Output:

<img width="833" height="365" alt="437350433-14d39904-c6f7-44ce-b457-d1bd810c6df5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a59f3c60-2112-4c7e-bfa2-0629480f9f59" />



## Result:
Thus, the C program to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation is implemented successfully
